# poncon - a command sender for pongoOS

A stupid python script. I wanted to send commands easily, so I wrote this. Type commands to send them to your device in pongoOS, or send single commands.

## Usage

`-h` - Show help message


`-c [CMD]` - Send single command


`-s` - Default mode, send commands in a shell-like environment
